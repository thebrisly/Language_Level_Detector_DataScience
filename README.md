## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the UNIL_Geneva_DSML (Data Science and Machine Learning) project! 

Our primary goal is to develop and test various machine learning models on French text data to determine the level of difficulty. For instance, given a sentence like "J'aime les pommes" (I like apples), our model aims to predict the corresponding language proficiency level, such as A1.

## 2. Objective
The main objective of this project is to explore and implement different machine learning algorithms to effectively categorize the difficulty levels of French texts. By leveraging a diverse range of models, we seek to enhance our understanding of how well these algorithms can perform in the context of language proficiency assessment. Once we implemented a great algorithm, we need to create a real-world application with a user-friendly interface. 

## 3. Methodology
To achieve our goal, we split things up into 5 different stages :

- Data Collection: Downloading and understanding a dataset of French texts annotated with their corresponding language proficiency levels (& lean the data if necessary).
- Model Selection: Experimenting with various machine learning models, such as natural language processing (NLP) models, deep learning architectures, and traditional classifiers.
- Training and Evaluation: Training the selected models on the prepared dataset and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.
- Optimization: Fine-tuning the models to improve their accuracy and generalization capabilities (& trying to increase the official dataset).
- User-Friendly Interface : Creating a small website that uses our model and can predict the level of any sentence given to it (with a % of failure - of course).

To deepen our systematic thinking, we'll now examine each element in detail.
